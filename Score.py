"""
Score.py
A package that is in charge of managing the scores file.
The scores file at this point will consist of only a number. That number is the accumulation of the winnings of the user.

Amount of points for winning a game is as follows:
POINTS_OF_WINNING = (DIFFICULTY X 3) + 5
Each time the user is winning a game, the points he won will
be added to his current amount of point saved in a file.
